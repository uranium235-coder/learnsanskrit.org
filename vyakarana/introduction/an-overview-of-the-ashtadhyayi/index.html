    <h1>An overview of the <cite>Aṣṭādhyāyī</cite></h1><aside class="note"><p><p>Feel free to skip this lesson and come back to it later.</p></p></aside><h2>The shape of the text</h2><p>Adult learners of the <cite>Aṣṭādhyāyī</cite> often think that the text's rules have
an unusual or unintuitve ordering. Why do the rules of the <cite>Aṣṭādhyāyī</cite>
have the ordering that they do? There are two basic factors that are
responsible.</p><p>The first factor is that the <cite>Aṣṭādhyāyī</cite> is part of a long oral
tradition. This fact has several important implications:</p><ul><li><p>In traditional Sanskrit education, students chant and memorize several
  works by rote. Many students don't even understand what they're chanting! So
  there is less reason to make the rules follow an intuitive order.</p></li>
  <li><p>Older students begin to study and unlock the <i>contents</i> of what they
  have memorized with the help of a skilled teacher. At every point in the
  education process, the student can rely on an expert who has memorized and
  understood the entire text.</p></li>
  <li><p>A memorized rule can be recalled at a moment's notice regardless of where
  it is in the text, so there is less pressure to rearrange rules into a
  specific order.</p></li>
  <li><p>Oral compositions tend to be more fluid than written compositions: they
  borrow heavily from past works, and they generally change over the
  generations.</p></li>
</ul><p>The second factor is that the <cite>Aṣṭādhyāyī</cite> aims for overall concision (<span lang="sa" class="sa2">lāghava</span>) in its total length. Again, this fact has several important
implications:</p><ul><li><p>Two rules that share a similar context might be grouped together even if
  the operations they describe are conceptually different.</p></li>
  <li><p>Two rules that are conceptually quite similar might be split apart if
  their contexts are different enough.</p></li>
  <li><p>Some interpretations of the text would make a rule purposeless (<span lang="sa" class="sa2">vyartha</span>), which contradicts the general spirit of <span lang="sa" class="sa2">lāghava</span>. On this
  basis, an interpretation of the system is invalid if it makes a rule
  purposeless.</p></li>
  <li><p>Likewise, rules are usually stated the way they are for a specific
  reason. Often, that reason is an indicator (<span lang="sa" class="sa2">jñāpaka</span>) of a critical
  principle of interpretation.</p></li>
</ul><p>To some extent, these factors are in tension. The <cite>Aṣṭādhyāyī</cite>'s origin in
an oral tradition means that a particular rule's ordering is relatively less
important. But the <cite>Aṣṭādhyāyī</cite>'s emphasis on overall concision means that
a rule's ordering can be vitally important.</p><h2>Sections of rules</h2><p>In practice, the result is that the <cite>Aṣṭādhyāyī</cite> is a set of <dfn>sections</dfn>, where the specific ordering of sections is not very important but the
ordering of rules <i>within</i> a section is highly important.</p><p>Likewise, the eight chapters of the <cite>Aṣṭādhyāyī</cite> generally follow a
logical flow:</p><ol><li><p>Definitions and rules of interpretation.</p></li>
  <li><p>The compound system.</p></li>
  <li><p>Root suffixes: verb endings, derived roots (<span lang="sa" class="sa2">sanādi</span>), suffixes that
  make nominal bases (<span lang="sa" class="sa2">kṛt</span>), and auxiliary suffixes (<span lang="sa" class="sa2">vikaraṇa</span>) inserted
  between the root and the verb suffix.</p></li>
  <li><p>Nominal suffixes (part 1).</p></li>
  <li><p>Nominal suffixes (part 2).</p></li>
  <li><p>Duplication (<span lang="sa" class="sa2">dvitva</span>), vowel sandhi, and accent.</p></li>
  <li><p>Various suffix substitutions, as well as sound changes caused by suffixes.</p></li>
  <li><p>Various sandhi rules.</p></li>
</ol><p>So although there are some exceptions, the derivation of a specific word
usually flows smoothly from book 1 to book 8.</p><p>More specifically, the derivation often follows this basic structure:</p><ol><li><p>Add and define the base of the derivation. For verbs,
  this is a verb root. For nominals, this is a nominal stem. (Chapters 1 and 2)</p></li>
  <li><p>Add any suffixes needed in the derivation. (Chapters 3, 4, and 5)</p></li>
  <li><p>Apply sound changes caused by the specific suffixes. (Chapters 6 and 7)</p></li>
  <li><p>Apply sandhi changes to merge all terms together into a single
  expression. (Chapter 8)</p></li>
