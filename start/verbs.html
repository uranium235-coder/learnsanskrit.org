<h1>Verb Basics</h1>
<h2>Our First Sanskrit Word</h2>
<p>Here is our first Sanskrit word:</p>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">गच्छामि</p>
<p lang="sa">gacchāmi</p>
<p>I go.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Take the time to pronounce this correctly. The syllable pattern is "heavy, heavy, light." The <span lang="sa">ch</span> is an aspirated sound, so it should be spoken with an extra puff of air. The <span lang="sa">ā</span> is a long vowel sound. The <span lang="sa">i</span> at the end is sometimes pronounced as <span lang="sa">ī</span> — but you should keep the sound short regardless. This is a light syllable, after all!</p>
<p>Now, what do we notice about this sentence? For one, the English version takes two words, but the Sanskrit needs just one. <span lang="sa">gacchāmi</span> exists as a single word! This must mean that the idea of "I" is contained somewhere in the word <span lang="sa">gacchāmi</span>. Remember, this "I" is called the <dfn class="old">subject</dfn> of the verb.</p>
<h2>Endings and Verb Number</h2>
<p>Now, let's compare <span lang="sa">gacchāmi</span> to another verb:</p>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">गच्छामः</p>
<p lang="sa">gacchāmaḥ</p>
<p>We go.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What has changed, and what has stayed the same?</p>
<p>The most noticeable difference that the verb's ending has changed. Appropriately enough, this ending is called the <dfn>ending</dfn>. It is unclear where the ending stops or starts, though, so let us leave our discussion there for now.</p>
<p>We also notice a change in meaning. The idea of "go" is still in the word, but we have changed "I" to "we." This is called a change of the verb's <dfn>number</dfn>. We were talking about <strong>one</strong> thing before; words that refer to one thing are said to have <dfn>singular</dfn> number. Now we are talking about <strong>many</strong> more; words that specify multiple things are said to have <dfn>plural</dfn> number. For convenience, we can say that a word is <dfn>in</dfn> a certain number. For example, we can say that <span lang="sa">gacchati</span> is <strong>in</strong> the singular.</p>
<p>Sanskrit verbs also have a special ending for just two things:</p>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">गच्छावः</p>
<p lang="sa">gacchāvaḥ</p>
<p>The two of us go.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Verbs that specify just <strong>two</strong> things are said to be in the <dfn>dual</dfn>. Whenever we're talking about just two objects, we <strong>must</strong> use the dual. Whenever we're talking about three or more objects, we <strong>must</strong> use the plural.</p>
<p class="note box">In English, we see this division in the words "one," "both," and "all." If we want to ask somebody to bring us two books, we can't say "Bring all of the books," but we <strong>can</strong> say "Bring both of the books." And if we want to ask somebody to bring us three books, we can't say "Bring both of the books," but we <strong>can</strong> say "Bring all of the books."</p>
<h2>Stems and Verb Person</h2>
<p>Now let's bring in another verb:</p>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">गच्छसि</p>
<p lang="sa">gacchasi</p>
<p>You go.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What's changed? What's stayed the same?</p>
<p>Here, the verb ending has changed. We talked about this above. But now we see that there is a sort of "core" to the verb. All of the forms we've seen so far are just extensions of the more basic <span lang="sa">gaccha</span>. This <span lang="sa">gaccha</span> is called the <dfn>verb stem</dfn>. Once you have the verb stem, you can attach endings to it to make a full verb.</p>
<p>For instance, here is a new stem for you: <span lang="sa">bodha</span>, meaning "awaken." How would you say "you awaken" ?</p>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">बोध + सि → बोधसि</p>
<p lang="sa">bodha + si → bodhasi</p>
<p>You awaken.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>We also notice a new change in meaning. The idea of "go" is still there, but we've changed "I" to "you." This is called a change of the verb's grammatical <dfn>person</dfn>. Before, we were talking about things that included ourselves, with "I see," "the two of us see," and "we see." In English, this is called the <dfn>first person</dfn>. Now, we're talking about things that include the person we're talking to, but not us. In English, this is called the <dfn>second person</dfn>. As before, we can say that a verb is <dfn>in</dfn> some grammatical person.</p>
<p>But there is also one more person, appropriately called the <dfn>third person</dfn>. Verbs in the third person talk about neither the speaker nor the person spoken to.</p>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">गच्छति</p>
<p lang="sa">gacchati</p>
<p>He goes.</p>
</li></ul>
<h2>Review</h2>
<p>Our verbs are made of <strong>stems</strong> followed by <strong>endings</strong>. These endings can have three different persons (I, you, he) and three different numbers (one, two, three or more).</p>

<dt>dual</dt><dd>Referring to <strong>two</strong>. A dual verb must refer to exactly two subjects, like "the two men" or "the two of you."</dd>
<dt>plural</dt><dd>Referring to <strong>three or more</strong>. A plural verb must refer to at least three subjects, like "the men" or "the countries." Since English doesn't have a dual number, "they go" could be translated by either a dual verb or a plural verb.</dd>
<dt>person</dt><dd>One of a verb's properties. The verb's person tells us <strong>who does the action</strong>, according to the speaker.</dd>
<dt>first person</dt><dd>Referring to the <strong>speaker</strong> ("I") and anybody else with the speaker.</dd>
<dt>second person</dt><dd>Referring to the person <strong>spoken to</strong> ("you") but not the speaker ("I").</dd>
<dt>third person</dt><dd>Referring to <strong>neither</strong> the speakers nor those who are spoken to ("he," "she," "it," "they").</dd>

<p>Now we will study some basic Sanskrit verbs. Actually, these verbs are all complete Sanskrit sentences. For more information, you can start with the next lesson, which discusses the easiest verb form of all.</p>
